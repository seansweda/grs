Things to fix/change/add in GRS

Bug Fixes
1) fc w/o an out causes a seg fault, ex: with runners on 2nd and 3rd,
   the following sequence will bomb: fc b1233h; hr;
2) when escaping a dr/dc with 0, the 0 does not get put in the cmd file
3) pb does not generate unearned run prompt
4) illegal event codes return 'incorrect baserunning' if there is
   location or baserunning data
5) runners should only advance if forced by catchers interference
*) unearned runs kludge

Events to Add:
1) rule 7.05 play, event code ?
2) baserunner interference code - 'ri'
3) cutoff play, runner out, perhaps as a rundown code?
*) swing and miss on H&R
*) specific IFR/OFR codes

Interface:
1) double-check runner advancement, make sure runners exist
2) help screen, possibly a grep of the docs file?
3) make some plays like 'dp' more user friendly
*) interactive lineup entry
*) better interface?

Features:
1) translate non-capitalized team names
2) code for injuries, standardized output (will help league office!)
*) check master database for valid name/team combinations
*) output decisions under linescore
*) allow use of 4 instead of "h" in baserunning

*low priority item
