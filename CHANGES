This is the latest and greatest grs construction program.

VERSION HISTORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2.0	* lots of refactoring to make user input even more bullet-proof
	* prohibit input of nonsense positions and illegal baserunning
	* re-implement redo in memory
	* fix bug exposed by gcc stack protector
	* fix bug where passed balls (pb) were not recorded
	* fix bug that prevented baserunning string from explicitly
	  holding runner on a base (e.g. "wp 1233")

3.1.1	* prevent undo infinite loop

3.1.0	* track batters faced (BF)
	* display current pitcher's IP & BF totals
	* prevent overwriting of existing output files
	* check for valid defensive lineup
	* fix undo after dc bug

3.0.1	* fix baserunner queue bug
	* sanity check for outs on play
	* pb was incorrectly crediting team with error

3.0.0	* changed to 2-line prompt,  added score & half inning indicator
	* added a lot of input verification code, eliminated a bunch of
	  potential buffer overruns making user input more bullet-proof
	* fixed a nasty bug caused by a fc with no out recorded
	* fixed a nasty double-free which could cause undo to die
	* fixed a nasty bug which would cause segfault on error where
	  no player could be found in the lineup at that position
	* error messages are much more helpful now
	* fixed bug when escaping dr/dc with 0 was not recorded in .cmd
	* pb & ci now result in unearned run prompt
	* runners only advanced when forced on ci
	* team codes will be automatically converted to upper case
	* added "in" & "ic" events for infield in comments
	* baserunner staying at same base now legal (e.g. "22")
	* fixed bug in assigning cs with other runners advancing
	* "en" with less than 3 outs not allowed (use "eg")
	* commands which fail baserunning checks are not recorded in .cmd,
	  also full baserunning now recorded in .cmd

2.7.2	* fixed several known bugs
	* made pbp output nicer
	  (oldest release in version control)

2.7.1	* added double steals
	* fixed bug which caused incorrect first batter of the game

2.7.0	* undo now universal, and hopefully bug-free

2.6.4	* fixed more bugs with -f flag.

2.6.3	* added "nj" and "fa" codes.

2.6.2	* bug fixes to 2.6.x, which was never released
	* now more flexible in dealing with file input, using -a -h and -f.

2.5.0	* prompts for unearned runs

2.4.4	* bug fix for some stupid mistakes created in v2.4.2

2.4.3	* added event codes (kc, la, lh, fp)
	* W/L/S code recorded in .cmd file

2.4.2	* added default baserunning for events that previously required
	  baserunning to be entered (cs, sb, dp, etc.)

2.4.1	* changed a variable name that conflicts with Visual C++

2.4.0	* Made GRS adhere to unix rules of flags, operands.  Thus,
	  loading lineups now requires -f filename.  The output
	  file prefix is always the last item.  Now it is again
	  possible to re-direct output (e.g. grs test < oldcmd.cmd),
	  as GRS no longer assumes the output prefix will be
	  operand X.

2.3.0	* Fixed stupid bug in v2.2.0, where runner on base by error
	  would not get queued into the runners queue, thus causing
	  the dreaded "segmentation fault".
	* added the -v flag to output the version of grs.

2.2.0	* changed play-by-play output to remove redundancies, after
	  incessant whining by Richard Dunlap (Macon Peaches)  :-)

2.1.2	* fixed bug in "np" which would not output correct MLB team
	  for pitcher inserted by method added in version 2.1.0

2.1.1	* fixed minor formatting problem with "cm"
	* added additional event codes: "dp" and "hb"

2.1.0	* "np" will allow the user to optionally place the pitcher
	  in the batting order

2.0.3	* lineups may now be read in from an external file, but they
	  must be in the same format as they are written to .cmd file

2.0.2	* made redo quieter by redirecting output to /dev/null

2.0.1	* user now prompted for wins, losses, and saves

2.0.0	* undo now a "redo" command, works better than undo

1.1.1	* starting pitchers now listed in .pbp file

1.1.0	* inherited runners now charged to correct pitcher

1.0.0	* undo semi-functional
	* "eg" command works
	* LOB now tabulated

0.90 the extra stats (E, PB, GIDP, etc.) no longer have to be entered
     manually, grs prints each stat in the following format:
     STAT: # - players.  example:  E: 2 - Harper, King.

0.88 grs now generates linescores automatically, including team runs
     hits and errors.

0.87 added a defensive position change command "dc", added multiple
     position output to the stats

0.86 fixed bug that would not recognize a home run with runners on base
     unless the user inputted the baserunning manually, also added a
     default baserunning advance of 1 base that does not put the batter
     on base

0.85 made locations for all events optional

0.84 fixed bug that advanced all baserunners on a walk

0.83 .cmd file now contains all user input, including comments and
     player changes

0.8  added default baserunning advances for most events, and eliminated
     multiple baserunning advances

0.75 added the .cmd file, to record user input and make it easier to
     debug the program

0.7  changed .pbp output to the format:
     [player name] [event] [location], [baserunning].
