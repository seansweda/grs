This is the latest and greatest grs construction program.

VERSION HISTORY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.0.0	* Changed to 2-line prompt.  Added score & half inning indicator.
	* Added a lot of input verification code.  Eliminated a bunch of
	potential buffer overruns.  User input is more bullet-proof now.
	* Fixed a nasty bug caused by a fc with no out recorded.
	* Fixed a nasty double-free which could cause undo to die.
	* Fixed a nasty bug which would cause segfault if an error made but
	no player could be found in the lineup at that position
	* Error messages are much more helpful now.
	* Fixed bug when escaping dr/dc with 0, was not recorded in .cmd
	* pb & ci now result in unearned run prompt
	* runners only advanced when forced on ci
	* Team codes will be automatically converted to upper case.
	* Added "in" & "ic" events for infield in comments
	* baserunner staying at same base now legal, e.g. "22"
	* fixed bug in assigning cs with other runners advancing

2.7.2	Fixed several known bugs.  Made pbp output nicer.

2.7.1	Added double steals.  Fixed bug which caused incorrect
	first batter of the game.

2.7.0	(skipped various incarnations between versions)
	Undo now universal, and hopefully bug-free.

2.6.4	Fixed more bugs with -f flag.

2.6.3	Added "nj" and "fa" codes.

2.6.2	Bug fixes to 2.6.x, which was never released.  GRS now more
	flexible in dealing with file input, using -a -h and -f.

2.5.0	Prompts for unearned runs.

2.4.4	bug fix for some stupid mistakes created in v2.4.2

2.4.3	added a couple of event codes (kc, la, lh, fp), fixed W/L/S
	code so that it is recorded in .cmd file

2.4.2	added default baserunning for events that previously required
	baserunning to be entered (cs, sb, dp, etc.)

2.4.1	changed a variable name that conflicts with Visual C++

2.4.0	Made GRS adhere to unix rules of flags, operands.  Thus,
	loading lineups now requires -f filename.  The output
	file prefix is always the last item.  Now it is again
	possible to re-direct output (e.g. grs test < oldcmd.cmd),
	as GRS no longer assumes the output prefix will be
	operand X.

2.3.0	Fixed stupid bug in v2.2.0, where runner on base by error
	would not get queued into the runners queue, thus causing
	the dreaded "segmentation fault".
	Also, added the -v flag to output the version of grs.

2.2.0   Changed play-by-play output to remove redundancies, after
	incessant whining by Richard Dunlap (Macon Peaches).  :-)

2.1.2	Fixed bug in "np" which would not output correct MLB team
	for pitcher inserted by method added in version 2.1.0.

2.1.1	Fixed minor formatting problem with "cm".  Also added and
	documented some additional event codes: "dp" and "hb".

2.1.0	A "np" command will allow the user to optionally place the
	pitcher in the batting order.

2.0.3	Lineups may now be read in from an external file, but they
	must be in the same format as they are written to the .cmd
	file.

2.0.2	Made redo quieter, by redirecting output to /dev/null.

2.0.1	User now prompted for wins, losses, and saves.

2.0.0	Undo now a "redo" command.  Works better than undo.

1.1.1	Starting pitchers now listed in .pbp file.

1.1.0	Inherited runners now charged to correct pitcher.  

1.0.0 	Undo semi-functional.  Also, the "eg" command works.  
	LOB now tabulated.

0.90 the extra stats (E, PB, GIDP, etc.) no longer have to be entered
     manually, grs prints each stat in the following format:
     STAT: # - players.  example:  E: 2 - Harper, King.

0.88 grs now generates linescores automatically, including team runs
     hits and errors.

0.87 added a defensive position change command "dc", added multiple
     position output to the stats

0.86 fixed bug that would not recognize a home run with runners on base
     unless the user inputted the baserunning manually, also added a
     default baserunning advance of 1 base that does not put the batter
     on base

0.85 made locations for all events optional

0.84 fixed bug that advanced all baserunners on a walk

0.83 .cmd file now contains all user input, including comments and
     player changes

0.8  added default baserunning advances for most events, and eliminated
     multiple baserunning advances

0.75 added the .cmd file, to record user input and make it easier to
     debug the program

0.7  changed .pbp output to the format:
     [player name] [event] [location], [baserunning].
